<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# Income prediction for Azubian <a name="about-project"></a>

**Income Prediction Challenge for Azubian** Income inequality, characterized by the uneven distribution of income within a population, is a growing concern in developing nations worldwide. The rapid advancement of AI and automation could exacerbate this issue if not addressed. This challenge aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual earns above or below a certain income threshold. By leveraging such models, we can potentially reduce costs and enhance the accuracy of monitoring critical population indicators, such as income levels, between census years. This information is crucial for policymakers to better manage and mitigate income inequality on a global scale.

## üõ† Built With <a name="Technologies Used"></a>
Income Prediction Challenge for Azubian was done following the CRISP-DM process. It also involved a variety of technologies, programming languages, and libraries to process, analyze, and visualize the data. The following tools were utilized:
1. _Python_: Python programming language was the backbone of the project, used for data processing, analysis, and visualization tasks.

2. _Pandas_ and NumPy: Pandas and NumPy libraries were essential for data manipulation and numerical computations.

3. _Matplotlib and Seaborn_: Matplotlib and Seaborn were employed for data visualization, creating insightful charts and graphs to represent the findings.

4. _Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebooks_: Jupyter Notebooks within the Visual Studio IDE provided an interactive environment for running code, visualizing data, and documenting the analysis process.

5. _Scikit-learn_: Scikit-learn's library SimpleImputer was utilized for imputing null values in the amount column.

6. _Streamlit_: Streamlit is an open-source Python framework for data scientists and AI/ML engineers to deliver interactive data apps ‚Äì in only a few lines of code.

7. _FastAPI_: is a web framework first released in 2018 for building HTTP-based service APIs in Python. It is used for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python-type hints. FastAPI is based on Pydantic and uses type hints to validate, serialize and deserialize data.

8. _Docker_: Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.

9. _Optuna_: Optuna is an automatic hyperparameter optimization software framework, particularly designed for machine learning.

10. _GitHub_: GitHub served as the version control system for the project, enabling collaboration and tracking changes in the codebase.
    These technologies played a crucial role in the successful implementation of the project, providing the necessary tools to analyze and derive insights from the Indian Startup Ecosystem funding datasets.

  <summary>Data Sources</summary>
  <p>The dataset provided for this project was provided by Zindi for their learning competition dubbed 'Income Prediction Challenge For Azubian'. It includes various citizens and non-citizens demographic attributes and their corresponding incomes collected from a random population. There are ~200 000 individuals in train and ~100 000 individuals in the test file. The dataset is subject to strict usage restrictions and can only be used for the purpose of this assignment. The data directory consists of both the training and testing data.</p>
