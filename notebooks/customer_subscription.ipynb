    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "Current marketing strategies often involve reaching out to a large pool of clients without a clear understanding of their likelihood to subscribe. This approach results in wasted resources and low conversion rates. A predictive model can provide a data-driven solution to identify potential subscribers more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "- The primary business goal is to enhance the effectiveness of marketing campaigns for term deposits by predicting the likelihood of a client subscribing to one. By leveraging operational data, the organization aims to target the most promising clients, thereby improving campaign efficiency, reducing costs, and increasing subscription rates.\n",
    "- The key objective is to create a machine learning model capable to predict whether a given customer will subscribe to a serveice or not based on his \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Key Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "- Marketing  (End-Users of Product): Use insights from the model to design targeted marketing campaigns, optimize outreach efforts, and monitor campaign performance to increase subscription rates and ensure customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sales Team: Leverage model predictions to prioritize leads and improve follow-up efficiency to enhance client engagement and close deals effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Science Team: Develop and maintain the predictive model. Collect, clean, and analyze data; build and validate the model; and provide actionable insights to ensure technical accuracy, scalability, and usability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- IT and Data Engineering Team: Support system integration and data pipelines. Provide infrastructure, ensure data availability, and integrate the model into existing systems to maintain smooth technical operations and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Executive Management: Decision-makers and project sponsors. Define strategic objectives, allocate resources, and monitor project impact to align the project outcomes with business goals, such as cost reduction and revenue growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Success Metrics\n",
    "- Business Success: Increase in term deposit subscriptions and reduced marketing costs.\n",
    "- Analytical Success: A predictive model with high accuracy, precision, and recall (90% or more) to identify potential subscribers.\n",
    "- Deployment Success: Integration of the predictive model into the marketing workflow to guide decision-making.\n",
